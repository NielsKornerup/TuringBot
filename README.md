This is a groupme bot for the Turing 2020 groupme. To add functionality, you can add else if statements with regex to the postMessage function in bot.js. While you can add functionality, I will need to redeploy the app for it to be implemented. If you want to help on this project, current goals include:

1) Refactor the code so that it is even easier to write your own commands
2) Add a database/database functionality so that we can store data between deployments - allowing us to do things like have a add quote command.
3) Figure out how to set up a markov chain using said database so that we can have an imitate command for different people in chat.
4) Figure out the xkcd node API so that we can parse comic names and hover-over texts. Also, we could use this to prevent the bot with returning invalid images if the comic could not be found.
5) Preform a critter battle - users can submit critters through some other source and add them to a database. People can then request two existing critters to battle one another and the bot will return the winner. A good way to decide arguments. Note - this will be challenging (probably) and might not be of much interest, but I think it would be cool.
5) Figure out how to write a method where the bot can be activated or deactivated off of a password that either changes after each use, or find some other way to direct message the bot, telling it to turn on and off.
7) Auto generate help method - this could be related to refactoring. I am not sure about the best way to do this.
6) Adding more features! We could always use more commands for the bot.

Even if you are uncomfortable with javascript/don't have the time to implement features, let me know what you would want to see implemented.
